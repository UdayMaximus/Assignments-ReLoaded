This Notebook contains a feedforward neural network implemented on Fashion-Mnist dataset.
It has the back propagation algorithm, some optimisation algorithms that are built from scratch
Performed various sweeps using different hyper parameter configurations using wandb and calculated accuracies on validation sets
Identified the best model out of all these and tested it on test data
